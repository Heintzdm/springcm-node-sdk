This SDK currently provides a limited feature set, as it was created and is developed primarily for internal IT work at Stria.

Accessing the REST API requires you create an API user in your SpringCM account and assign a client ID to that user in the REST API section of Account Preferences. Once set, you can use the API by providing the client ID and corresponding secret. The client ID and client secret are provided by SpringCM's support staff on request.
